# Note Taker Assignment

## Description

This application can be used to write, save and delete notes. This application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The user can input a title and text into the designated area of the note. The user can save the note, and even delete the note later if they choose to.

## Instructions

The user can input whatever title and text they would like into the designated input fields. After the user is satisfied with their note, they can click the save button in the top right corner and the note's title will appear in the list to the left. If the user wishes to view the note later, they can simply click on the note in the list area to the left. If the user would like to delete the note, they can easily do so by clicking the delete icon to the right of the note title they wish to delete.
